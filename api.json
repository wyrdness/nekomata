      "full": "Nekomata (猫又, \\\"forked cat\\\" or \\\"two-tailed cat\\\") is a powerful type of Japanese yokai—a supernatural cat spirit distinguished by its split or forked tail. More powerful and dangerous than the bakeneko, nekomata are cats whose tails have split into two after reaching an advanced age (typically 13+ years) or growing to an unusual size. These formidable yokai possess devastating supernatural abilities including shape-shifting into human form with perfect accuracy, necromancy (the power to control and manipulate corpses as puppets), fire magic, and even flight. Nekomata can grow to enormous proportions, with some legends describing them as large as lions. While some nekomata are former domestic cats that transformed with age, others are terrifying wild mountain-dwelling variants that actively hunt humans. Generally portrayed as malevolent, nekomata often seek vengeance against cruel former owners or act as dangerous, independent spirits."
