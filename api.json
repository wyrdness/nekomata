      "summary": "A two-tailed cat yokai, more powerful than bakeneko. Nekomata are cats whose tails have split or forked after many years, granting them enhanced supernatural abilities including shape-shifting, necromancy, and fire magic.",
      "full": "Nekomata (猫又, 'forked cat' or 'two-tailed cat') is a type of Japanese yokai representing a more powerful form of supernatural cat than the bakeneko. The defining characteristic of nekomata is their split or forked tail, which appears after the cat reaches an advanced age (often cited as 13+ years). These yokai possess formidable supernatural powers including shape-shifting into human form, necromancy (the ability to control and manipulate corpses as puppets, making them dance or speak), fire magic, and even flight. Nekomata can grow to enormous sizes, with some legends describing them as large as lions. While some nekomata are domestic cats that transformed with age, others are wild mountain-dwelling variants that actively hunt humans. These mountain nekomata are particularly feared in Japanese folklore. Nekomata are generally portrayed as more malevolent than bakeneko, often seeking revenge against cruel former owners or acting as independent, dangerous spirits. The traditional practice of cutting cats' tails short was specifically meant to prevent this transformation, contributing to the development of the Japanese Bobtail breed. Famous legends include stories of nekomata replacing their murdered masters and living undetected among humans."
