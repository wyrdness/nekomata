## Overview

Nekomata (猫又, "forked cat" or "two-tailed cat") is a powerful type of Japanese yokai—a supernatural cat spirit distinguished by its split or forked tail. More powerful and dangerous than the bakeneko, nekomata are cats whose tails have split into two after reaching an advanced age (typically 13+ years) or growing to an unusual size.

These formidable yokai possess devastating supernatural abilities including shape-shifting into human form with perfect accuracy, necromancy (the power to control and manipulate corpses as puppets), fire magic, and even flight. Nekomata can grow to enormous proportions, with some legends describing them as large as lions.

While some nekomata are former domestic cats that transformed with age, others are terrifying wild mountain-dwelling variants that actively hunt humans. Generally portrayed as malevolent, nekomata often seek vengeance against cruel former owners or act as dangerous, independent spirits.

## Famous Legends

### The Nekomata of Nabeshima

One of the most famous nekomata tales involves a cat that killed a prince's favorite concubine and then perfectly impersonated her, living undetected at court while slowly draining the prince's life force through nightly visits. The deception was only discovered when a loyal retainer stayed awake to guard the prince and witnessed the transformation.

### Mountain Hunter Tales

Numerous folktales describe encounters with enormous mountain nekomata that hunted travelers, using their supernatural abilities to trap and kill humans in remote mountain passes.

## Cultural Significance

### Historical Impact

The fear of nekomata transformation had profound effects on Japanese culture:

**Japanese Bobtail Breed**: The widespread practice of cutting cats' tails short to prevent transformation into nekomata directly contributed to:
- Development of naturally short-tailed cats
- Cultural preference for bobtailed cats
- The modern Japanese Bobtail breed
- This practice was specifically aimed at preventing the tail-splitting transformation

### Traditional Prevention

According to folklore, nekomata could be prevented by:
- **Cutting cats' tails short** — Most common preventive measure
- **Not allowing cats to grow too old** — Preventing transformation age
- **Killing large or old cats** — Extreme prevention (cruel practice)
- **Proper respectful treatment** — Preventing vengeful transformation

**Modern Note**: These are historical folklore beliefs reflecting past cultural anxieties, not recommended practices.

## Cultural Sensitivity Note

> ⚠️ **Important**: Nekomata are part of traditional Japanese cultural heritage with roots extending back to at least the Kamakura period (1185-1333). They represent genuine cultural tradition within Japanese folklore and the broader yokai belief system, reflecting historical attitudes toward animals, death, and the supernatural. These should be understood and respected as living cultural tradition, not merely fictional characters.

---

## Theories & Interpretations

### Folkloric Explanations

**Age and Tail-Splitting Transformation**: Traditional belief that extreme age causes physical and spiritual transformation, manifesting as the split tail.

**Size-Based Power**: Unusually large cats seen as already partway to supernatural status.

### Cultural Interpretations

**Animistic Tradition**: Reflects Shinto belief that all beings, especially long-lived ones, can develop spiritual power (kami).

**Social Control**: Stories may have served to:
- Reinforce proper treatment of animals
- Create respect for nature and its power
- Warn against cruelty to dependent creatures
- Address anxieties about revenge and justice

**Death and Mourning Symbolism**: The necromantic abilities may reflect cultural processing of death, loss, and the fear of the dead returning.
