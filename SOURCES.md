## Cultural Sensitivity Note

When researching nekomata and other yokai:
- These represent living cultural traditions with deep historical roots
- Respect for cultural context is essential
- Traditional knowledge should be approached with appropriate reverence
- Popular media interpretations may differ significantly from traditional folklore
- Indigenous Japanese cultural perspectives should be prioritized
